One good thing about keeping this sort of 'diary' is that it's a very handy place to keep track of my notes, and what I've done and still need to do. Getting my travel visa to get into Nepal in the first place seems to be a bit of a fiddly affair, needing a whole checklist to itself.

The Adventure Co. tells me I need the following:

* acquire visa on arrival
* 2 passport photos
* $40 (USD) for 30 days
* 6 months validity on my passport


That's what's applicable to me, anyway. See their PDF for <a href="https://www.adventurecompany.co.uk/files/uploads/visa_information/nepal-req2.pdf">more details</a>. or differing circumstances (shorter/longer visas, children, extensions,Â etc.)

The Lonely Planet guide pretty much tells me the same. There're a number of different routes of acquiring the documents you need, but they all amount to the same thing.

Okay, so I guess that's not so bad ... basically remember some passport photos and a stack of US currency. Happy days.

Afterthoughts:

Getting a visa was definitely easy. You can use any major currency to buy a visa - they'll work out how much you need to pay, and give you the corresponding change in Nepalese Rupees. You don't even need to have photos with you - there'll be a guy there ready to take your photo (for an extra charge). There are a few forms which require some strange details, like your flight number, so be sure to keep stuff like that on you.
