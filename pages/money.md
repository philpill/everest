Nepalese Rupee

125NPR  = 1GBP (roughly divide by a hundred and a bit less than that)

Keep GBP and USD for changing

There was no difference between USD and GBP in terms of use - both are accepted. I understand the value of GBP better, so I would've been better off sticking to just GBP.

Can't buy Nepalese Rupee in UK, but lots of places to change in the city when you get there

Main currency in Nepal in city and while trekking

Used approx Â£400, mostly due to prolonged stay in city.

You never seem to get exact change - penny Rupees exist, but are worthless.

Used up every last, literal penny in Kathmandu airport, buying coffees.
