We went to Pangboche?

This lodge was owned by a guy who had summited Everest twice and his wife (I think). She carried a little baby in a basket with the strap around her forehead (the typical Nepalese way of carrying loads around here). The baby was so swaddled in blankets we didn't notice it in the corner of the room by itself for the first hour or so of sitting down.

Also, I had to get up to go to the toilet in the middle of the night - it was an outdoor affair (just outside of the photo above, to the right) and it was colllllld!
