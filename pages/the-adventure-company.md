It didn't take me much to decide who to go with. A quick Google for 'Everest base camp trek' results in a whole load of companies offering their services and I pretty much went with whoever had the best website, haha. Let that be a lesson for business owners everywhere.

They have lots of details on their website about the trip itself, including what you should take, how you should prepare and where you'll be going. Stuff like that is exactly what's needed to reassure any budding trekker. They also have some top notch customer support - ready to respond to any questions you might have via phone, email or online chat.

Booking a trip through a company like this is always going to be more expensive than doing it yourself, but if you're a newbie trekker like myself, it's probably best to have someone show you the ropes and make sure you don't get into any trouble, especially if you're going by yourself.
