Unfortunately, I remember very little of the final few days, other than my knee blowing out from all the giant steps we were walking down. Alex gave me a tubigrip bandage to use, Sonja gave me some Deep Heat and Zoe lent me one of her trekking poles ... thanks guys! I'm not sure I would've made it down the mountain without all that ...

To this day, my knee is knackered from all that downhill walking. I highly recommend trekking poles, even if you don't think you're gonna need them.

Tengboche - Namche

Saturday 26th November

Namche - Lukla

Sunday 27th November

The place was eerily silent compared to our first visit - seems everyone who was previously stranded had managed to make their way out. We said goodbye to our porters and to Anil and Ashori - they would be waiting for the group to arrive for their next adventure. Then it was one more flight on the ride of death!

Lukla - Kathmandu

We went to Rum Doodles once more for one final dinner and to nail up our foot!

Monday 28th November

Fly home :)
