<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namche_Bazaar">Namche Bazaar</a> (3440m) is the last large town before you hit the mountains. The main shopping touristy area is made up of maybe two or three streets with shops and lodges selling everything a trekker might need. Along with the usual food and souvenir stalls, these were also quite a few mountain hardware and clothing stores.

I asked Hari how far it was to walk from Lukla to Baecamp. I think he said it was about 120km.

My room was right underneath the lodge, and it was a tad damp. It did have an en suite bathroom with a shower though. I never did understand how the hot water worked - I think there was a limited supply which is piped to everyone, and it was first come, first served, then you were meant to pay for the usage.

For some reason, I thought the blankets were for sleeping on and slept a bit colder than I needed to in just my sleeping bag. I also managed to develop an awful headache towards the end of today, and lost some night's sleep tossing and turning in bed - it felt a lot like a hangover. Was probably still acclimatising.

Leaving my room in the morning, I was greeted with the most spectacular view of the mountains. What an amazing thing to see on your doorstep. Beautiful.
