<p>So yeah, I got my final injections today, and man are these things expensive. I totally recommend everyone to go get the ones you can on the NHS through your doctor instead of leaving it till the last minute like I have (my own personal doctor is back home in Doncaster and I've a feeling trying to get registered here in London will be like looking for a taxi to take you to Basecamp).</p>
<p>I was surprised such a little travel clinic existed in the center of London (it's not even on the outskirts near airports or anything - the one I went to was in <i>Turnpike Lane</i>&nbsp;...) and apparently the owner of this chain (they've a few stores around London now) used to live around this area, which does kinda make sense I guess.</p>
<p>The branch I'd been frequenting was not a huge place, but big enough that each time I went, I was seen to by a different nurse - each being lovely in their own way (as nurses generally are, I guess). As today's nurse was preparing to stab me with bits of metal and chemical, I asked her about her work, to like, distract me from the impending pain (yeah, I'm a wuss).</p>
<p>Turns out she was freelance, and worked at Nomad whenever they needed her, but mostly she was a volunteer with <a href="http://www.vso.org.uk/about/">VSO</a>,&nbsp;and had only recently returned to London from a six month stint in Cameroon where she had set up her own clinic out in the sticks.</p>
<p>She spent her time helping village people who had no access to education or medical treatment and in return, they gave her undying gratitude - a far cry from what doctors and nurses receive in this country. I think she said Kenya might be next for her, and I can't help but be completely amazed at what this woman is accomplishing. The stories she told me in the 40 minutes I was there were incredible. She told me how she was treated like royalty, and how everyone in the village knew and greeted her. I doubt she was paid for her work, but they let her stay in a luxury apartment for free and offered to clean and cook for her. Makes me wonder why she bothers coming back to London.</p>
<p>Her job is to help countless people around the world <i>for nothing</i>.</p>
<p>My job is to help a multinational company sell tickets for music events so shareholders get more money.</p>
