<p>I don't think I've ever really had a decent camera, but it'd probably be a shame to go out to the mountains without one.</p>

<p>Update: Canon S95</p>
<p>After much reviewing of cameras and my bank balance, I settled for a <a href="http://www.dpreview.com/products/canon/compacts/canon_s95">Canon S95</a>. It's a good combination of size and price (£260 at the time at <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00400OK52">Amazon</a>). No way as powerful as the G12 above, but having handled one over the weekend, I don't think I'll be needing the slightly longer zoom or the extra features. I will have to up my game to make up for the lack of long range panoramic shots though, but looking at it from that point of view, I don't think I could do mountain shots any justice with anything less than <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Canon-Digital-SLR-Camera-Mark/dp/B001E97GIK/">Canon 5D</a> and a massive lens.</p>

<p>Crap, I just saw that <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Canon-PowerShot-S100-Digital-Camera/dp/B005N5NF6I/">S100 </a>has just been released, but wow ... it costs even more than the G12 ...</p>
<p>Afterthoughts:</p>
<p>Feel free to check out the results out at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/philpill/sets/72157628203769011/">Flickr</a>.</p>

<p>The camera didn't seem to have any problems with the cold, and everyone suggested keeping the batteries warm inside jacket pockets and sleeping bags to prolong their capacity. I had two spare batteries, but there wasn't any point where the batteries actually ran out.</p>
<p>The lack of wide angle or telescopic lens meant the variety of shots taken was quite limited, but acceptable, given the convenience and weight saved.</p>
<p>I only had a single 32gb memory card, but I recommend taking a few, and using them alternately. This way, if you lose the camera for any reason, you'll still have some photos.</p>
<p>If you want to take pictures on the move, try to get a camera with a fast response (quick save to memory and power on/off times) so you don't miss opportunities or fall behind the group.</p>
