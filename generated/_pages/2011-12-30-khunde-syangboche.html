<p>Sunday 20th November</p>

<p>Woke up early to walk through conservation area up to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syangboche_Airport">Syangboche</a> (3,841m) and back down to acclimatise.</p>
<p>Bloody yaks! Get out the way!</p>

<p>We pretty much spent half the day hanging around in Namche once we got back. Sarah wandered off to an internet cafe while the other guys went off to their rooms to do coupley stuff (I guess).</p>
<p>I did some minor shopping - loaded up on chocolate bars and got some Diamox and Immodium (just in case), then went back to teahouse to sit about and read more tales of mountain disaster (I was properly in love with my Kindle by this point - I was into my second book or so).</p>

<p>I had written down in my notes that today's walk was particularly hard, but little did I know of what was to come - today would be a country stroll by comparison ...</p>
