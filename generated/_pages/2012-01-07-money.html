<p>Nepalese Rupee</p>
<p>125NPR  = 1GBP (roughly divide by a hundred and a bit less than that)</p>
<p>Keep GBP and USD for changing</p>
<p>There was no difference between USD and GBP in terms of use - both are accepted. I understand the value of GBP better, so I would've been better off sticking to just GBP.</p>
<p>Can't buy Nepalese Rupee in UK, but lots of places to change in the city when you get there</p>
<p>Main currency in Nepal in city and while trekking</p>
<p>Used approx Â£400, mostly due to prolonged stay in city.</p>
<p>You never seem to get exact change - penny Rupees exist, but are worthless. </p>
<p>Used up every last, literal penny in Kathmandu airport, buying coffees.</p>
